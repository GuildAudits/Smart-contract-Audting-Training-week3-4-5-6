## Unsafe delegate call smart contract vulnerability

An unsafe delegate call vulnerability in a Solidity smart contract is an attack where an attacker can call an external contract using a delegate call, potentially leading to unintended changes in the contract's state. This can occur when a contract does not properly validate the external contract's code before making the delegate call or does not properly handle re-entrant calls to the external contract.

# An example of a contract that is vulnerable to an unsafe delegate call attack is a contract that allows users to call an external contract without proper validation:

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
 contract Vulnerable { 
     address payable externalContract; 
     function callExternalContract(bytes memory _data) public { 
    externalContract.delegatecall(_data); }
    }
In this example, the contract's callExternalContract function allows users to call an external contract using a delegate call, but does not properly validate the external contract's code before making the delegate call. An attacker can call this function with malicious data, potentially leading to unintended changes in the contract's state.

To prevent unsafe delegate call attacks, it's important to ensure that contracts properly validate the external contract's code before making the delegate call, and handle re-entrant calls to the external contract.

# Here is an example of how to prevent the unsafe delegate call using the previous Vulnerable contract example:

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
 contract Safe { 
address payable externalContract;
function callExternalContract(bytes memory _data) public {
require(address(this).delegatecall(bytes4(keccak256("someFunction()"))), "function not found in external contract"); externalContract.delegatecall(_data); } 
}

In this example, the contract's callExternalContract function uses a require statement to check if the external contract has a specific function "someFunction()", this way, the contract can ensure that the external contract has the required function before making the delegate call.

Another way to prevent unsafe delegate call is to use libraries like "OpenZeppelin" that provides a "SafeMath" contract and a "SafeERC20" contract that can be used to validate the external contract's code and handle re-entrant calls.

In summary, to prevent unsafe delegate call attacks in Solidity smart contracts, it's important to ensure that contracts properly validate the external contract's code before making the delegate call, and handle re-entrant calls to the external contract. This can be done by using require statements, libraries such as "OpenZeppelin" that provide functions to validate the external contract's code.
