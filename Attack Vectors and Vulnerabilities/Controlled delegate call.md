# Controlled delegate call

This vulnerability occurs when delegatecall() or callcode() to an address is controlled by the user and allows execution of malicious contracts in the context of the callerâ€™s state. Ensure trusted destination addresses for such calls. 

## Code Example
```
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Proxy {

  address owner;

  constructor() public {
    owner = msg.sender;  
  }

  function forward(address callee, bytes _data) public {
    require(callee.delegatecall(_data));
  }

}
```
