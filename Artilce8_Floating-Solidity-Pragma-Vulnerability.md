# Floating Solidity Pragma Vulnerability

Solidity compiler directives known as floating pragmas are solidity compiler that lacks a version number, making them susceptible to version mismatch problems if the compiler version changes. If the smart contract is not constructed to be compatible with the upgraded compiler version, this may result in unexpected behavior or security flaws. 

## Here is an example of floating pragmas:
```
pragma solidity;
```
This pragma does not specify a version number, and is therefore considered a floating pragma. It will use the latest version of the Solidity compiler that is available which may not be compatible with how the smart contract was constructed and this will leads to function breakdown and vulnerability in the contract.

The contract could potentially be compiled with a different version of the Solidity compiler, leading to potential version mismatch errors.

## Solution to Floating Solidity Pragma Vulnerability
It is typically advised to provide a specific compiler version in the pragma directive, and avoid using Floating Solidity Pragma  in your Solidity contracts.

## Here is an example of a Solidity contract with a fixed pragma:

```
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MyContract {
    // contract code goes here
}
```

By specifying the caret (^) symbol before the version number, this specifies that the contract is compatible with any version of Solidity that is version 0.8.0 or higher, but less than 0.9.0. This ensures that the contract will always be compiled using the same version of the compiler, and will not be susceptible to changes made by an attacker.
