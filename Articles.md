Title: Unchecked Call Return Value Vulnerability in Solidity

In Solidity, Call, CallCode, DelegateCall, and Send are a few low-level call methods that operate on raw addresses. These low-level methods never throw exceptions; however, if an exception is encountered during a call, they will return false. it is possible to make external function calls to other contracts using the `call()` function. This function returns a boolean value indicating whether the call was successful or not.

However, if the return value of the `call()` function is not checked, it could lead to a vulnerability known as the "Unchecked Call Return Value" vulnerability. This can occur if the contract calls another contract and then continues to execute code, assuming that the call was successful, even if it actually failed.
Example
Pay attention to the contract below:

    pragma solidity ^0.6.0;
    
    contract Wallet {
        address public owner;
        uint public balance;
    
        constructor() public {
            owner = msg.sender;
            balance = 0;
        }
    
        function depositFunds() external payable {
            balance += msg.value;
        }
    
        function withdrawFunds(uint amount) external {
            require(amount <= balance, "Insufficient balance.");
            balance -= amount;
            msg.sender.call.value(amount)("");
        }
    }
    

This contract implements a simple wallet where the owner can deposit and withdraw funds. The `withdraw()` function sends the specified amount of funds to the caller's address.
However, there is a vulnerability in this contract. If the `call()` function fails (e.g. due to an out-of-gas exception), the balance in the wallet will still be reduced. This means that the caller could potentially withdraw more funds than they are entitled to.
To fix this vulnerability, we can simply add a check to verify that the `call()` function returned successfully:


    pragma solidity ^0.6.0;
    
    contract Wallet {
        address public owner;
        uint public balance;
    
        constructor() public {
            owner = msg.sender;
            balance = 0;
        }
    
        function depositFunds() external payable {
            balance += msg.value;
        }
    
        function withdrawFunds(uint amount) external {
            require(amount <= balance, "Insufficient balance.");
            balance -= amount;
            require(msg.sender.call.value(amount)(""), "Call failed.");
        }
    }
    

Now, if the `call()` function fails, the contract will revert with the message "Call failed." and the balance will not be reduced.

Conclusion
It is important to you manage the probability that the call will fail if you decide to use the low-level call methods by always checking the return value of the `call()` function in Solidity to prevent the "Unchecked Call Return Value" vulnerability. Failing to do so can result in incorrect contract behavior and loss of funds.

Title: Integer Overflow/Underflow in Solidity

For Solidity versions greater and equal to (>=) 0.8, Solidity's default behavior for overflow/underflow is to throw an error. For Solidity versions less than 0.8, Integers overflow/underflow without any issues.

However, what exactly are integer overflows and overflows, and how are they prevented?

In Solidity, integers are limited in size and can only hold a certain range of values. For example, an `uint8` (unsigned 8-bit integer) can hold values from 0 to 255. In other words, the largest number we can store is 11111111 in binary, or  (2^8 - 1 = 255) in decimal. If an operation is performed that results in a value outside of this range, it can cause an integer overflow or underflow.

An integer overflow occurs when the result of an operation is larger than the maximum value that the integer can hold. For example:

    pragma solidity 0.6.0;
    
    contract IntegerOverflow {
        uint8 public num;
    
        function setNumber(uint8 _num) public {
                num = _num;
        }
        
        function addToNumber(uint8 _num) public {
            num += _num;
        }
    }
    

In this contract, if we set `x` to 255 and then call `addToNumber(1)`, the value of `x` will become 0 because of the integer overflow because  If you add 1 to binary 11111111, it resets back to 00000000.

An integer underflow occurs when the result of an operation is smaller than the minimum value that the integer can hold. For example:

    pragma solidity 0.6.0;
    
    contract IntegerUnderflow {
        uint8 public num;
    
        function setNumber(uint8 _num) public {
            num = _num;
        }
    
        function subtractFromNumber(uint8 _num) public {
            num -= _num;
        }
    }
    

In this contract, if we set `x` to 0 and then call `subtractFromNumber(1)`, the value of `x` will become 255 because of the integer underflow.

Prevention
To prevent integer overflows and underflows, using a Solidity compiler that is at least version 0.8.0 is the simplest method. The compiler will automatically check for overflows and underflows in Solidity 0.8.
For example:

    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    
    pragma solidity 0.8.0;
    
    contract IntegerOverflowAndUnderflowPrevention {
    
        uint256 public num;
        
    function setNumber(uint256 _num) public {
                num = _num;
        }
        
        function addToNumber(uint256 _num) public {
            num += _num;
        }
        
    function subtractFromNumber(uint256 _num) public {
            num -= _num;
        }
    }

You can alternatively use the SafeMath library from openZeppelin. The SafeMath  library provides safe variations of functions that automatically handle overflow and underflow scenarios. Keep in mind that SafeMath only functions with uint256 and Solidity version 0.8.0.
The following contract, for instance, uses the SafeMath  library to securely add and subtract numbers from num:


    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    
    pragma solidity 0.8.0;
    
    import "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/math/SafeMath.sol";
    
    contract IntegerOverflowAndUnderflowPrevention {
        using SafeMath for uint256;
        uint256 public num;
        function setNumber(uint256 _num) public {
            num = _num;
        }
        function addToNumber(uint256 _num) public {
            num = num.add(_num);
        }
        function subtractFromNumber(uint256 _num) public {
            num = num.sub(_num);
        }
    }

Now, if we set `x` to 255 and call `addToNumber(1)`, or set `x` to 0 and call `subtractFromNumber(1)`, the contract will revert with an error message.

Conclusion
In Solidity smart contracts, integer overflows and underflows can produce unexpected and potentially unsafe behavior. It is important to use the SafeMath library or manually handle overflow/underflow conditions by using only Solidity version 0.8.0 and above to ensure the correctness and security of your contract.

Title: Reentrancy in Solidity


Reentrancy is a form of vulnerability that can happen in Solidity contracts when an external contract has the ability to call the main smart contract function repeatedly in order to drain its funds before the original call has ended.

A Solidity reentrancy attack continually removes money from a smart contract and transfers it to an unapproved contract until the money is gone. When malicious actors discover a vulnerable smart contract, the attack takes place within the blockchain's execution cycle. 

Millions of dollars have been lost to reentrancy attacks affecting blockchain systems and DAOs.  The DAO hack, Lendf.me, and Cream Finance are a few well-known examples of reentrancy attacks that exploited vulnerabilities in blockchain systems.

How does Reenterancy vulnerability happen?

Consider the following contract:

    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    
    pragma solidity 0.8.0;
    contract SimpleBank {
      mapping (address => uint) credit;
        
      function deposit(address _to) payable public{
        require(msg.value > 0, "Add amount to deposite");
        credit[_to] += msg.value;
      }
        
      function withdraw(address _to) public{
            uint256 acctBalance = credit[msg.sender];
            (bool sent, bytes memory data) = _to.call{value: acctBalance}("");
            require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
            credit[msg.sender]-=acctBalance;
        
      }  
      function checkBalance(address _account) public view returns(uint) {
           return  credit[_account];
      }
    }

Users can deposit money into this contract (using the deposit() function) and withdraw money from it (using the withdraw() function). The 'withdraw()' function transfers the money to the caller's address and subtracts the requested sum from the contract's balance.

This contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks, unfortunately. A malicious contract made by an attacker could make repeated calls to "withdraw()" before the initial call has finished.

This malicious contract can generate an instance of the SimpleBank contract and call the SimpleBank contract's "withdraw()" function . The fallback function may contain a function that repeatedly calls the withdraw function when a condition is met.

The "withdraw()" function keeps executing if there is money in the contract until it is exhausted. The'require()' statement in the 'withdraw()' method won't be activated as a result, allowing the attacker to withdraw more money than they are authorized to.

Prevention

The caller's balance must be set to zero before making an external call (transferring ether out) in order for the balance to remain zero even when there is a callback after the first call has ended. This will fix the vulnerability.

Here is an illustration of how to write the contract in a safer manner:

    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    
    pragma solidity 0.8.0;
    contract SimpleBank {
      mapping (address => uint) credit;
        
      function donate(address _to) payable public{
        require(msg.value > 0, "Add amount to donate");
        credit[_to] += msg.value;
      }
        
      function withdraw(address _to) public{
            uint256 acctBalance = credit[msg.sender];
            require(acctBalance > 0, "Low balance");
            credit[msg.sender] = 0;
            (bool sent, bytes memory data) = _to.call{value: acctBalance}("");
            require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
      }  
    
      function checkBalance(address _account) public view returns(uint) {
           return  credit[_account];
      }
    }


We can use a Reentrancy Guard or mutex (mutual exclusion) pattern to stop several calls from occurring simultaneously, which will increase the contract's security.

For instance:


    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    
    pragma solidity 0.8.0;
    contract SimpleBank {
      mapping (address => uint) credit;
      bool entered;
    
      modifier customReentrancyGuard() {
            require(!entered);
            entered = true;
            _;
            entered = false;
        }
        
      function donate(address _to) payable public{
        require(msg.value > 0, "Add amount to donate");
        credit[_to] += msg.value;
      }
        
      function withdraw(address _to) public customReentrancyGuard {
            uint256 acctBalance = credit[msg.sender];
            require(acctBalance > 0, "Low balance");
            credit[msg.sender] = 0;
            (bool sent, bytes memory data) = _to.call{value: acctBalance}("");
            require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
      }  
    
      function checkBalance(address _account) public view returns(uint) {
           return  credit[_account];
      }
    }

A reentrancy guard has been added to this code to thwart attackers who might attempt to repeatedly call the "withdraw" function. The "isEntered" boolean, which is used by the reentrancy guard, prohibits the function from being invoked when it is true. To prevent any errors, we may alternatively use OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard. We also set the caller's balance to zero before transferring Ether to further protect the contract from vulnerabilities. Before making calls to the outside world, this is done to update the contract's status. This is known as the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern.

As a result, we have successfully corrected a contract that had been exposed to reentry attacks.

I sincerely hope that this article has assisted you in preventing reentrancy vulnerability.

Thanks for reading.


# Article 4
Title: Outdated Compiler Version

Solidity-written smart contracts may be seriously security vulnerable if their compilers are out of date. This article will look into the issue of outdated compiler versions and cover methods for reducing the likelihood that your smart contracts include vulnerabilities.

Newer versions of compilers can provide new language features that weren't there in the compiler's first release, which can lead to vulnerabilities. Take the following Solidity contract, for instance:


    pragma solidity ^0.4.24;
    
    contract MyContract {
        uint public balance;
    
        constructor() public {
            balance = 100;
        }
    
        function add(uint _value) public {
            balance += _value;
        }
    }
    

This contract specifies that it was written for Solidity version 0.4.24 or later using the `pragma` statement at the top of the file. If this contract is compiled using a newer version of Solidity that introduces a new language feature, such as the `emit` keyword, the contract will still be able to use this feature even though it was not available when the contract was written.

This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially create vulnerabilities in the contract. For example, consider the modified version of the contract:

    pragma solidity ^0.4.24;
    
    contract MyContract {
        uint public balance;
    
        constructor() public {
            balance = 100;
        }
    
        function add(uint _value) public {
            balance += _value;
            emit NewBalance(balance);
        }
    
        event NewBalance(uint newBalance);
    }

We've added an event to this iteration of the contract that is called each time the add function is used. The emit keyword, which was absent in Solidity version 0.4.24, is used to emit this event. This contract will be allowed to utilize the emit keyword and the event will be triggered as expected if it was compiled using a more recent version of Solidity. The emit keyword is not supported by older versions of Solidity, hence the compiler will throw an error if the contract is compiled using one of those versions.

Let’s see another example:


    pragma solidity 0.4.24;
    contract SimpleDAO {    
      function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        msg.sender.call.value(amount)());
    } 
    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        if (credit[msg.sender]>= amount) {
          credit[msg.sender]-=amount;
          msg.sender.call.value(amount)();
        }
      }   

The code above would not throw an error when compiled because of the compiler version, but the format for performing a call has been changed in  newer versions of Solidity:

Using a higher compiler version, the code would be modified to:


    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    pragma solidity 0.8.0;
    contract SimpleExample {
        
      function withdraw(uint amount) public { 
          msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
      }  
    }

Solidity compiler version 0.8.0 requires a SPDX declaration statement and the syntax for performing a call has been changed.  Hopefully, you see one of the possible problems caused by using an outdated compiler version.
 
Using an outdated compiler version can be challenging, especially if the current compiler version has bugs and issues that have been made public. When new versions of the compiler are published, these issues are typically fixed. Using out-of-date compiler versions exposes your smart contract to attacks from malicious parties who take advantage of the corrected defects, which can cause a lot of problems.

It is crucial to make sure that your contracts are constantly compiled using the most recent version of Solidity in order to reduce the possibility of vulnerabilities brought on by out-of-date compiler versions.

    pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

By doing this, you can be sure that your contract is created with the most recent version of Solidity and that it will benefit from any newly added language features or enhancements and bug fixes.

To make sure you are always utilizing the most recent version of Solidity, it is also a good idea to periodically examine and update the pragma statement in your contracts. By doing this, you'll be able to protect your contracts from vulnerabilities brought on by out-of-date compiler versions.

In conclusion, outdated compiler versions can introduce vulnerabilities from fixed bugs and issues made public. It can also introduce bugs from old language features that has been changed or from new language features that weren’t present when the contract was prepared , leading to vulnerabilities in Solidity contracts. It is higly recommended to use a recent stable version of the Solidity compiler.

# Article 5
Title: Floating Pragma Vulnerability

In the previous article, outdated solidity compiler version was examined. Floating pragma is related to it becasue it still has to do with the Solidity compiler version.

What is Floating pragma?

Floating pragma is a `pragma` statement in a Solidity contract that does not specify a specific version of the compiler rather it specifies a range of compiler versions that can be used for compilation. For example: 

    pragma solidity ^0.4.0; //Compiles with versions between 0.4.0 and latest version
    pragma solidity >=0.4.0 < 0.8.0;  //Compiles with all versions between 0.4.0 and 0.8.0
    pragma solidity >0.4.13 <0.8.0; 
    pragma solidity 0.4.24 - 0.5.2;

Developers should stay away from using floating pragma (refer to the example given below). The best practice is to deploy the contract to the mainnet after locking a pragma version.Different pragma versions being used in test and mainnet may pose unidentified security issues.

Prevention

To mitigate the risk of vulnerabilities caused by floating pragmas, it is important to specify a specific version of Solidity in the `pragma` statement of your contract. For example:

    pragma solidity 0.8.0;

This will make sure that your contract is created using a particular version of Solidity and that it makes use of any newly added language features or bug patches. Additionally, it will stop the contract from being built using an outdated compiler that might not support specific language features.

To make sure you are constantly utilizing the most recent version of Solidity, it is also a good idea to frequently review and update the "pragma" statement in your contracts. This will make it easier to guarantee that your contracts are safe and devoid of flaws brought on by floating pragmas.

Conclusion

Finally, by enabling the usage of many compiler versions on a single contract, floating pragmas can lead to vulnerabilities in Solidity contracts. In order to reduce this risk, it's crucial to choose a specific version of Solidity in the contract's "pragma" declaration and to frequently examine and update this statement to guarantee that you're always utilizing the most recent compiler.

# Article 6
Title: Frontrunning Vulnerability

The distributed ledger of the blockchain does not instantaneously update with new transactions. They are gathered into blocks, and only added to the ledger as a part of these blocks. A malicious node can view the transaction, determine its purpose, and create his own malicious request (transaction) based on the observed transaction before it is included in a block because the transaction is visible to the nodes as it is propagated to the network.
Usually, the transaction fees are used to decide the order in which transactions are put to blocks. Blockchain users can determine their own costs, while most blockchains have a minimum charge.

This implies that a user has the option to pay for priority, by putting a higher fee on a transaction.
This means that the miners have control over the order in which transactions execute and can mix early transactions with their late ones without broadcasting them, this could occur as a result of them trying to maximize their profits by adding transactions to blocks based on fees rather than the order in which they are received.

The scenario described above is the procedure that takes place during frontrunning.

So what does frontrunning actually mean?

Decentralized systems, such as blockchain networks, are susceptible to frontrunning. It refers to the the action of one party trying to acquire an unfair advantage over another by foreseeing what will happen next and using that knowledge to their own advantage.

For example, when a person sees a significant trade being made on a decentralized exchange, they may engage in frontrunning by swiftly buying or selling the same asset before the original trade can be completed. While the initial trade itself might not be profitable, this enables the frontrunning party to profit from the price change it generated.

To explain this more,  consider a simple auction contract written in Solidity as an illustration:

    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    pragma solidity 0.8.0;
    contract Auction {
        address public owner;
        uint public highestBid;
        address public highestBidder;
        constructor()  {
            owner = msg.sender;
        }
        function bid(uint _bid) public payable {
            require(_bid > highestBid);
            require(msg.value == _bid);
            require(highestBidder != msg.sender);
            if (highestBidder != address(0)) {
                payable(highestBidder).transfer(highestBid);
            }
            highestBid = _bid;
            highestBidder = msg.sender;
        }
        function endAuction() public {
            require(msg.sender == owner);
            payable(owner).transfer(highestBid);
        }
    }

Users can bid in  this simple auction this contract. The bid() function allows users to make new bids as long as they are higher than the highest bid currently being accepted and they are not already the highest bidder. The endAuction() function enables the contract's owner to call off the auction and collect the winning bid.

This contract is susceptible to frontrunning, unfortunately. Think about the following example:

- Lucy submits a bid for the auction contract at 100 ETH.
- Before Lucy's first bid can be completed, Robert notices this bid and swiftly submits a greater bid of 110 ETH.
- Robert becomes the new highest bidder because the auction contract processes his higher bid first.
- Although Lucy's initial bid is processed, it is rejected since it is now less than the top bid.

In this case, Robert was able to foresee Lucy's conduct and use it to his advantage, thus outbidding her.

One method for resolving this issue is to implement a commit-reveal method in the bid function. 
A commit-reveal scheme can be implemented in an auction contract to prevent front running by requiring bidders to first "commit" to their bid by submitting a hash of their bid, rather than the actual bid itself. This hash is then stored in the contract, along with the bidder's address and the auction item ID.

When the auction ends, bidders are then required to "reveal" their actual bid by submitting it to the contract. The contract can then verify that the revealed bid matches the hash that was previously stored. If it does, the bid is accepted and the auction process can continue. If it does not, the bid is rejected and the auction continues without it.

This commit-reveal process helps to prevent front running because it makes it difficult for other bidders or third parties to see the actual bids being made in the auction. Without this visibility, it is difficult for them to adjust their own bids in real-time to try and outbid the original bidder.

As an illustration of how a commit-reveal method might be used in the auction contract, consider the contract:

    pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
    contract Auction {
        // Data structure to store bid information
        struct Bid {
            address bidder;
            uint itemId;
            uint value;
            bytes32 hash;
            bool revealed;
        }
        // Mapping to store all bids
        mapping(bytes32 => Bid) public bids;
        // Function to allow bidders to commit to their bid
        function commitBid(uint itemId, uint value) public {
            // Generate the hash of the bid
            bytes32 hash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(itemId, value));
            // Store the bid information in the contract
            bids[hash] = Bid({
                bidder: msg.sender,
                itemId: itemId,
                value: value,
                hash: hash,
                revealed: false
            });
        }
        // Function to allow bidders to reveal their bid
        function revealBid(uint itemId, uint value) public {
            // Look up the bid information for the given hash
            Bid storage bid = bids[keccak256(abi.encodePacked(itemId, value))];
            // Verify that the bid has not already been revealed
            require(!bid.revealed, "Bid has already been revealed");
            // Verify that the caller is the bidder associated with this bid
            require(bid.bidder == msg.sender, "Sender is not the bidder associated with this bid");
            // Set the revealed flag to true
            bid.revealed = true;
        }
    }
    

Conclusion
Paying transaction fees that are always high enough that front-running is no longer lucrative is the simplest method for avoiding it. To prevent front-running, nevertheless, this is an expensive and unsustainable approach.  Since front-running is a widespread problem on open blockchains like Ethereum. The ideal remedy is to take away the benefit of front-running, mostly by downplaying the significance of transaction sequencing or time. For instance, it would be preferable to use batch auctions in markets (this also protects against high-frequency trading concerns).The second option is to limit price slippage by defining a maximum or minimum allowed price range on a deal in order to reduce the expense of front-running.  Utilizing a pre-commit strategy—"I'm going to provide the specifics later"—is an additional option.

Title: State Variable Default Visibility Vulnerability

Any unknown visibility type of a function was set to public visibility type in older versions of the Solidity compilers. However, in more current versions, visibility type of the function must be specified in order to avoid the compiler throwing an error.

This vulnerability can still be introduced by improper use of State Variable Default visibility. It is imperative to test for this vulnerability since deployed contracts are immutable. One improperly defined state variable visibility can create a vulnerability that could jeopardize the entire contract.

What are state variables?
In Solidity, a smart contract's state variables are variables that may be accessed both from within the contract and from other contracts and applications. State variables have "public" visibility by default, allowing anyone on the Ethereum network to read and write to them.

However, if developers are not careful in how they use it, this default visibility may occasionally result in vulnerabilities. Malicious actors may, in particular, change or "spoof" the values of public state variables in order to take advantage of vulnerabilities in the contract.

The "uninitialized storage pointer" attack is an illustration of this sort of vulnerability. In this attack, a malicious actor can write to the storage location of an uninitialized pointer, possibly leading to contract failure or malfunction.

To demonstrate this vulnerability:


    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    pragma solidity 0.8.0;
    contract UninitializedPointer {
        
        uint public number; // Public state variable to store a number
        
        function setNumber(uint _number) public {  
            number = _number;          // Function to set the number
        }
    }

Anyone may call the "setNumber" function to change the number because the "number" state variable in this contract is publicly readable and write. In order to take advantage of the contract in some way, a hostile actor may use this to call the function with a faked number value.

It is best practice to make state variables private or internal by default and to only make them public if absolutely necessary in order to reduce this vulnerability. To accomplish this, simply substitute "private" or "internal" for the word "public" in the declaration of the state variable:

    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    pragma solidity 0.8.0;
    contract SecurePointer {
        
        uint private number; // Public state variable to store a number
        
        function setNumber(uint _number) public {  
            number = _number;          // Function to set the number
        }
    }

The "age" state variable is made private so that only the contract itself has access to it and can change it; it is not readable or modifiable by anybody else. This makes it more difficult for malicious actors to alter or falsify the value of the state variable.

It's also crucial to carefully assess a contract's functions' visibility because publicly available functions are vulnerable to abuse by malicious people. Take the following contract, for instance:

    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    pragma solidity 0.8.0;
    
    contract VulnerableContract {
        
        uint public balance;  // Public state variable to store a user's balance
        // Public function to transfer funds from the contract
        function transferFunds(address _to, uint _amount) public {
            require(balance >= _amount, "Insufficient funds");
            balance -= _amount;
            _to.transfer(_amount);
        }
    }

Since the "transferFunds" function in this contract is publicly accessible, anyone can use it to withdraw money from the contract. The function might be called by a malicious actor with a spoof _to address and a huge _amount value, though, in an effort to drain the contract's balance.

It is best practice to make functions private or internal by default and to only make them public if absolutely necessary in order to reduce this vulnerability. Simply substituting the word "public" with "private" or "internal" will accomplish this.

Conclusion
It is best practice to make state variables private or internal by default and to only make them public if absolutely necessary in order to reduce this vulnerability.

8. Tx.origin Vulnerability

In Solidity, Tx.origin is a global variable that returns the address of the account that originated the transaction. In other words, it is the address of the account that sent the original transaction that led to the execution of the current smart contract. However, in some circumstances, an attacker may be able to impersonate the tx.origin address, giving them access to a contract's functions and data without authorization.

The use of a malicious smart contract, also referred to as a "proxy contract," that stands between the original caller and the target contract is one common technique of exploiting this vulnerability. Before calling the target contract, the proxy contract can be used to change the tx.origin address, giving the attacker access that they are not entitled to.
Here is a demonstration of how this vulnerability might be used to access certain functions in a basic Solidity contract that checks the tx.origin address:

```
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MyContract {
    address public owner;

    constructor() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function doSomething() public {
        require(msg.sender == tx.origin, "Unauthorized access");
        // do something
    }
}
```

The contract in the above example has a function called doSomething that is only accessible by the account that initiated the transaction. To make it appear as though the original transaction was sent by the attacker's account, an attacker can change the tx.origin address before to the call if they create a proxy contract that calls doSomething.


Here is a modified contract that substitutes address(this).caller for tx.origin:

```
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MyContract {
    address public owner;

    constructor() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function doSomething() public {
        require(msg.sender == address(this).caller, "Unauthorized access");
        // do something
    }
}
```
This updated example still requires the caller address to be checked before granting access to the doSomething method, but it does so using address(this).caller rather than tx.origin. Because the contract is validating the caller address rather than the origin address, even if an attacker develops a proxy contract and changes the tx.origin address, they will not be able to get unauthorized access to the doSomething function.


Prevention
Avoid using the tx.origin address in your contracts; instead, use msg.sender or address(this). 

Additionally, you should use address(this).caller or address(this).origin rather than tx.origin as a condition to carry out an action.

Also, Utilizing libraries like Ownable from OpenZeppelin, which offers a safe and user-friendly solution, is another method to avoid this type of vulnerability.


It's crucial to pay attention to how addresses are used in smart contracts and to use the correct variable when determining authorisation.

I hope you remember this when you write your next smart contract. I'll see you in the next.

Adios!
