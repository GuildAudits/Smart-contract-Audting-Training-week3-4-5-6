## Insecure source of randomness solidity 
Insecure sources of randomness in Solidity smart contracts can lead to predictable outcomes and potential exploits in the contract's logic. For example, a contract that uses the block hash as a source of randomness can be exploited by an attacker who controls the miner, as the attacker can choose which block to mine, thus controlling the outcome of the contract.

# Here is an example of a contract that uses the block hash as a source of randomness:

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
contract RandomNumber {
 function generateRandomNumber() public view returns (uint) {
 return uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.timestamp, block.blockhash(block.number - 1)))); }
  }
In this example, the contract's generateRandomNumber function uses the keccak256 hash function to generate a random number based on the timestamp and previous block hash. However, as the miner can control which block is mined, they can control the outcome of this function.

To prevent this type of vulnerability, it is recommended to use a secure source of randomness such as an oracle service. The Oraclize library, for example, provides a "randomDS" datasource that can be used to generate a secure random number.

#Here is an example of how to use Oraclize to generate a random number:

pragma solidity ^0.8.0; 
import "https://github.com/oraclize/ethereum-api/oraclizeAPI.sol"; 
contract RandomNumber is usingOraclize { 
    function __callback(bytes32 myid, string memory result) public { // Do something with the result }
    function generateRandomNumber() public { 
    oraclize_query("random", "randomDS", "random number"); } 
    }
In this example, the contract uses the Oraclize "randomDS" datasource to generate a secure random number. The result of the query is passed to the contract's __callback function, where it can be used in the contract's logic.

It's also worth mentioning that using the built-in function crypto.random is not recommended because it is predictable and can be exploited.

In summary, using a secure source of randomness such as an oracle service is the best practice to prevent predictable outcomes and potential exploits in smart contracts that use randomness.
