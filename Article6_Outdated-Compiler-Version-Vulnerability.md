# Outdated Compiler Version Vulenrability

When compiling Solidity code using an outdated version of a compiler, vulnerabilities can be introduced. This is because newer compiler versions frequently include fixes for known vulnerabilities or problems that may exist in earlier ones. 

If you are using an older compiler, your contract may not benefit from these upgrades/fixes and may be vulnerable to exploitation. To ensure that your contract is as secure as possible, it is best to utilize the most recent stable version of the Solidity compiler.
