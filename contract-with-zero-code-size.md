## Contract with zero code size

The zero code size vulnerability is a vulnerability in Solidity smart contracts that allows an attacker to deploy a malicious contract that has zero code size. This can be used to exploit contracts that rely on the code size of a contract to determine its behavior. The zero code size vulnerability can be exploited by creating a malicious contract that has no code but still can receive Ethers from the fallback function.

# An example of a contract that is vulnerable to the zero code size attack is a contract that uses the code size of a contract to determine its behavior:

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
contract Vulnerable { 
address payable public target;
function setTarget(address payable _target) public {
require(target.codeSize() > 0, "Target contract must have code"); target = _target;
} }
In this example, the contract's setTarget function requires that the target contract has code (codeSize() > 0). However, an attacker can deploy a malicious contract with zero code size and call the setTarget function to set it as the target contract.

To prevent the zero code size vulnerability, it's important to ensure that contracts do not rely on the code size of a contract to determine its behavior. Instead, it's recommended to use other methods to validate a contract's code, such as checking its bytecode or using a code verifier library.

One way to prevent this vulnerability is to use the built-in bytes.length function instead of codeSize, because bytes.length returns the size of the bytecode, which is always non-zero.

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
contract Safe {
    address payable public target; function setTarget(address payable _target) public {
    require(bytes(_target).length > 0, "Target contract must have code");
    target = _target;
    } }

In this example, the contract's setTarget function uses the built-in bytes.length function to check if the target contract has code, which is always non-zero, even if the contract has no functions.

Another way to prevent this vulnerability is to use libraries like "SafeMath" or "OpenZeppelin" that provide a requireNotNull function that can be used to check if the address passed is the null address (0x0) or not.

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
import "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/utils/Address.sol";
contract Safe { 
    address payable public target; function setTarget(address payable _target) public {
    Address.requireNotNull(_target); target = _target;
} }

In this example, the contract's setTarget function uses the requireNotNull function from the Address library, to check that the passed address is not the null address (0x0), which is the address with zero code size.

In summary, to prevent the zero code size vulnerability, it's important to ensure that contracts do not rely on the code size of a contract to determine its behavior, instead, it's recommended to use other methods like checking its bytecode or using a code verifier library, or use built-in functions such as bytes.length or libraries like "SafeMath" or "OpenZeppelin" that provide a requireNotNull function.
